This release marks the second major update for Quick-FTXUI. 

## Changelog
- Added coloring options for components & DOM elements
- Added FTXUI's DOM elements, which are `Text`, `Paragraph`, `Separator` & `Borders`, along with their styles, wherever felt necessary
- Added ability to use C++ references as hooks to be used to QF's variables
- Added detailed user documentation, and hosted it via Github Pages. 

Next release, i.e., `v0.3`, will focus on making this project more accessible to work with, and of course, porting over more features from FTXUI.
